# passionfruit
![passionfruit logo](passionfruit.png)  
A very simple CSS frame work to simplify the lives of web designers.  
Less typing, more drinking juice.  
**NB:** Not ready for production use as yet. I've got some classes to rename and reshuffle. I've also got to remove some that are part of a personal project and do not meet the standard for passionfruit.css.

## Requirements:
- (Optionally) requires the Linux Biolinum font (not included yet - I have to review the licensing thingy and see if that is possible). You can use it without this font though. Just ignore or remove the .LBCap classes.
- A sense of humour.
- 3 Kittens. If you have any more or any less, you will die (not really).

## What's in it?
- Simple styles for margin, padding, and text styles.
- Simple CSS animations.
- Miscellaneous stuff.
- Simple, reusable components for use with bootstrap (part of passionfruit-bootstrap.css).
- Lot's of passionfruit juice.

## Classes written in Bajan :)
- I use my local Bajan dialect of English for naming most classes.
- This makes them easy to remember.
- Also makes them fun to use.

## Plays well with others
- passionfruit is designed to be non-intrusive; nothing is set by default.
- lightweight and simple, nothing too heavy or overwhelming.
- It is tested alongside Bootstrap, but should work with anything, because it is so simple.
- Will work well along with "Anole" (More on that later).
- With the exception of text and border classes, does not in any way affect the color of any element.
